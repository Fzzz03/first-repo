# What is AI?

Imagine you have a super-smart robot friend that learns like you do. You show it lots of cat pictures, and instead of explaining every detail, it figures out what makes a cat a cat by noticing patterns all by itself. That’s AI in a nutshell: teaching computers to learn from data so they can make decisions without step-by-step instructions.

## B. AI in Trading

In trading, AI acts like a tireless, lightning-fast assistant. It analyzes huge amounts of data, spots trends, and even predicts what might happen next—all by recognizing patterns in the numbers. It’s not magic; it’s simply very good at crunching data, which makes it a powerful tool in the fast-paced world of finance.

## C. Evolution of AI in Finance

AI in finance has evolved over time—here’s the full journey:

### 1. Early Days: Rule-Based Systems

At first, computers in finance followed strict instructions set by humans, called **rule-based systems**. Think of it like a recipe: “If this happens, do that.”

- **Example:** A rule might say, “Buy a stock when its price goes above its 50-day average.”
- These systems were useful but not flexible. If the market changed, they couldn’t adjust—they just kept following the same old rules.

### 2. Machine Learning: Learning from Data

Then came machine learning, where computers started learning from data instead of just following rules. You give them examples (like past stock prices), and they figure out patterns to predict what’s next.

- **Example:** If a stock often rises after dropping 5% in a week, machine learning might suggest buying after a dip.
- This was a big leap because computers could now “learn” and get better over time.

### 3. Deep Learning: Handling Complex Data

Today, we have deep learning, a more advanced type of machine learning. It uses neural networks (inspired by the human brain) to tackle huge, messy data—like news articles or social media posts.

- **Example:** Deep learning can read thousands of news stories about a company and decide if people feel good or bad about it, hinting at whether its stock might go up or down.
- It’s super powerful because it finds patterns humans might never spot.
