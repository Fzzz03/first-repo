# **Algebra and Linear Algebra in AI and Trading: Predicting Stock Prices with AI**

---

## **Introduction: How AI Relies on Algebra**

In AI-driven trading, algebra and linear algebra form the backbone of predictive systems.

Imagine Alex, a data scientist at a hedge fund, using AI to predict Nvidia’s stock price based on news sentiment scores. Behind the scenes, linear and quadratic equations — the core of algebra — power these AI models, turning raw market data into actionable insights.

Let’s explore how AI uses these mathematical tools.

---

## **Step 1: Linear Models – The Foundation of AI Predictions**

AI often starts with a **linear model**, which is grounded in linear algebra:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

Where:

* $y$: predicted stock price change
* $x$: sentiment score
* $m$: slope (learned by AI)
* $b$: intercept (adjusted by AI)

In AI, this is known as **linear regression** — algorithms use linear algebra to fit the best line through the data.

✅ **Example:**
If AI learns $m = 5$, $b = 0$, and $x = 0.8$:

$$
y = 5 \times 0.8 + 0 = 4\%
$$

---

**Activity 1: Test AI’s Prediction**
What’s the predicted price change if $x = 0.6$ in $y = 5x + 0$?
✅ **Answer:**

$$
y = 5 \times 0.6 = 3\%
$$

---

## **Step 2: Quadratic Models – Capturing Non-Linear Trends**

AI doesn’t stop at linear models. When sentiment triggers unpredictable price swings, AI uses a **quadratic model**:

$$
y = ax^2 + bx + c
$$

The $x^2$ term allows AI to capture non-linear patterns — essential in complex, volatile markets.

✅ **Example:**
If AI learns $a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 1$, and $x = 0.8$:

$$
y = -2 \times (0.8)^2 + 5 \times 0.8 + 1 = -1.28 + 4 + 1 = 3.72\%
$$

---

**Activity 2: Why Quadratic?**
Why does AI prefer quadratic models in volatile markets?
✅ **Answer:**
The $x^2$ term bends the prediction curve, helping AI capture large jumps or drops that linear models would miss.

## **Step 3: How AI Learns Using Linear Algebra in Python**

AI doesn’t **guess** the right coefficients — it uses linear algebra techniques (like **least squares**) to learn them from data.

✅ **Python Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sentiment scores and price changes
X = np.array([0.3, -0.5, 0.8]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([1.2, -3.8, 4.1])

# AI fits the model
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
print(f"AI Prediction for x=0.7: {model.predict([[0.7]])[0]:.2f}%")
```

---

**Activity 3: Adjust AI’s Prediction**
How would you modify the code to predict for $x = 0.4$?
✅ **Answer:**
Replace `[[0.7]]` with `[[0.4]]`. Expected output ≈ 2.30% (depending on the model fit).

---

## **Step 4: AI Tests and Compares Models**

AI uses **backtesting** to compare linear vs. quadratic models. In highly volatile markets, quadratic models often perform better due to their algebraic flexibility, allowing AI to handle extreme market movements.

✅ **Activity 4: Spot the Outlier**
Given data points: (0.3, 1.2), (-0.5, -3.8), (0.8, 4.1), (-0.9, -10.0) — which point challenges AI’s model the most?
✅ **Answer:**
(-0.9, -10.0) — a massive drop, requiring the model to adjust for sharp downturns.

---

## **Conclusion: AI, Algebra, and Trading**

✔ **AI’s Core:** Linear and quadratic equations are at the heart of AI predictions.
✔ **Algebra’s Power:** Linear algebra enables AI to learn from data efficiently.
✔ **Trading Impact:** Algebraic models help AI turn sentiment data into trading profits.
