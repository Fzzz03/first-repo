# Algebra and Linear Algebra in AI

Algebra and linear algebra might sound like complicated math topics, but they are actually the backbone of many technologies shaping our world today, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), data analysis, and machine learning.

To make this real, imagine Alex, a data scientist. His goal is to build an AI system that can predict how a company’s stock price might move after news comes out.

Here’s how his system works:

- Step 1: the AI **analyzes the text** of the news and assigns a **sentiment score**, a  number that reflects how positive or negative the news is.

- Step 2: the AI **predicts** how much the stock price will rise or fall, based on that sentiment score.

But how does the AI make that jump from **input numbers (sentiment scores)** to **output predictions (price changes)**?
This is where algebra and linear algebra step in.

### Foundations: Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities

Before we dive into linear models or advanced systems, it is important to understand the **basic mathematical tools** that make everything possible.


#### **Expressions vs Equations**

Let’s break this down clearly.

 **Expression**
  An expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations (like +, -, ×, ÷).
  **Important:** An expression does not have an equals sign.

  **Example 1:**

$$
2x + 3
$$



  This is simply describing a relationship or pattern between $x$ and the result. You cannot “solve” an expression because there is no equation to solve.

  **Example 2:**

  $$
  5y^2 - 7
  $$

  Again, just a combination — no equality or solution.

---

 **Equation**
  An equation is when an expression is set equal to something.
  **Important:** Equations can be solved because they give a specific condition.

  **Example 1:**

  $$
  2x + 3 = 7
  $$

  Here, you can solve for $x$ because it asks: “For what value of $x$ does the left side equal the right side?”

  **Solution:**

  $$
  2x + 3 = 7 \implies 2x = 4 \implies x = 2
  $$

  **Example 2:**

  $$
  5y^2 - 7 = 18
  $$

  Here, you would solve for $y$ by first isolating the variable.



* Expressions help describe relationships, like how strongly sentiment might affect price change.
* Equations help us calculate **specific** predictions, like “if sentiment is +0.8, how much will the price rise?”

---

#### **Try it Yourself**

1. Is this an expression or an equation?
   $3z^2 + 4z - 5$
   (Answer: Expression)

2. Solve for $x$ in the equation:
   $4x - 6 = 10$

3. Write an equation using a variable that models this sentence:
   “The predicted price change is three times the sentiment score plus 1 percent.”



---

#### **Inequalities**

Inequalities describe conditions, ranges, or boundaries — they tell us what values **can** or **cannot** happen, rather than giving an exact solution.

**Example 1:**

  $$
  x > 5
  $$

  This says $x$ can be any number **greater** than 5.

**Example 2:**

  $$
  y \leq 10
  $$

  This says $y$ can be **less than or equal to** 10.

---


### **Inequalities help define rules and limits. For example:**

* Only trigger a trade if the predicted price increase $> 2\%$.
* Avoid stocks where the predicted price drop $\leq -5\%$.
* Ensure the model’s risk exposure stays below a certain maximum.

---

#### **Practice Inequalities**

1. Which values satisfy the inequality $s < 0$?
   (

2. If the model predicts $p \geq 3$ percent, should you consider the trade according to a rule that only takes trades above 2 percent?

3. Write an inequality for this situation:
   “We will only invest if the expected profit is at least twice the expected loss.”

### Summary Table

| Concept        | What It Does                                                         | Example                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Expression** | Shows a relationship using variables and operations                  | $2x + 3$, $4y^2 - 1$        |
| **Equation**   | Sets an expression equal to something, so you can solve for unknowns | $2x + 3 = 7$, $y^2 - 1 = 8$ |
| **Inequality** | Sets a condition or limit on the values                              | $x > 5$, $y \leq 10$        |


---

### What is Linear Algebra?

Linear algebra builds on basic algebra, but instead of handling single numbers, it works with:

* **Vectors** (ordered lists of numbers)
* **Matrices** (tables or grids of numbers)

Linear algebra helps us process many data points at once, like hundreds or thousands of sentiment scores and price changes.
This is essential for AI, because modern models work on large datasets and need efficient ways to apply mathematical operations across them.

---

### 3. Linear Models in AI

In AI, we often use **linear models** to predict outputs based on inputs.
For example, Alex’s AI might use this equation:

$$
y = m x + b
$$

Where:

* $y$ is the predicted percent change in stock price
* $x$ is the sentiment score from news
* $m$ is a learned weight (how strongly sentiment affects price)
* $b$ is an adjustment (baseline price movement when sentiment is neutral)

---

### 4. Example Data Table

| Sentiment Score ($x$) | Actual Price Change ($y$) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 0.3                   | 1.2                       |
| -0.5                  | -3.8                      |
| 0.8                   | 4.1                       |
| -0.9                  | -10.0                     |

AI looks at data like this to learn the best values of $m$ and $b$,
so it can predict future price changes just from sentiment.

---

### 5. Predict the Price Change

Let’s say the AI finds:

* $m = 4$
* $b = 0.5$

What will be the predicted price change if the sentiment score $x = 1.0$?

**Solution:**

$$
y = 4 \times 1.0 + 0.5 = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 \text{ percent}
$$

So, the AI predicts a 4.5 percent increase.

---

### 6. Understanding the Slope and Intercept

* **Slope $m$:**
  This tells us how much the output changes for every unit change in the input.
  In Alex’s case, it tells how strongly sentiment affects price change.

* **If $m = 0$:**
  It means sentiment has no effect; price change is flat regardless of news.

* **Intercept $b$:**
  This is the baseline output when input is zero.
  So if the sentiment score is neutral ($x = 0$), the intercept tells what the AI predicts the price change will be.

---

### Apply What You Have Learned

Try solving these on your own.

1. **Simple Prediction**
   If $m = 3$, $b = 1$, and sentiment $x = -0.5$, what is the predicted price change?
   (Hint: $y = 3 \times (-0.5) + 1$)

---

2. **Understanding No Slope**
   If $m = 0$, $b = 2$, what will be the predicted price change no matter what $x$ is? Why?

---

3. **Intercept Interpretation**
   If sentiment is perfectly neutral ($x = 0$), and $b = -1$, what does the model predict for price change? What might this suggest?

---

4. **Extension: Try Your Own Numbers**
   Make up your own values for $m$, $b$, and $x$, and calculate the prediction.
   How does changing $m$ affect the outcome?
   How does changing $b$ affect it?

---

### Summary

| Concept        | Role in AI Modeling                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Algebra        | Describes relationships between input and output            |
| Linear Algebra | Handles many inputs and outputs at once (vectors, matrices) |
| Linear Models  | Predict outcomes using simple equations like $y = m x + b$  |
| Slope          | Measures how input affects output                           |
| Intercept      | Gives the base prediction when input is zero                |



---

### **Functions — Mapping Inputs to Outputs**

A **function** is like a machine:

* You provide an input $x$,
* The machine applies a rule $f(x)$,
* You get an output $y$.

---

| **Example Function** |
| -------------------- |
| $f(x) = 2x + 3$      |

If input $x = 1$:

$$
f(1) = 2 \times 1 + 3 = 5
$$

This kind of rule can represent how one variable (like a numerical score) affects another (such as predicted price movement).

Why is this useful in AI?
AI models often use functions — sometimes very complex or nonlinear — to transform raw input data (like text scores, prices, volumes) into useful predictions or classifications.

Without functions, we cannot systematically map input patterns to meaningful outputs.

---

### Apply a Simple Function**

Given $f(x) = 3x - 2$:

* Calculate $f(2)$
* Calculate $f(-1)$

How does the function handle positive vs negative inputs?

---

### **Polynomials: Modeling Nonlinear Relationships**

Polynomials expand functions by adding powers:

| **General Polynomial**                        |
| --------------------------------------------- |
| $y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots$ |

Example (quadratic):

$$
y = -x^2 + 4x + 1
$$

Why is this important in trading AI?
Markets rarely behave in simple, straight-line (linear) patterns.

* Small signals might barely affect price.
* Large, dramatic signals can cause outsized reactions.

Polynomials help AI capture these nonlinear relationships, making predictions that better match real-world market behavior.

---

### Explore Polynomial Shape**

Sketch or plot:

* $y = 2x + 1$ (linear)
* $y = -x^2 + 4x + 1$ (quadratic)

Where do they rise? Where do they bend?
How does adding the $x^2$ term change the behavior?


#### Compare Linear vs Polynomial**

Sketch or plot:

* $y = 2x + 1$ (straight line)
* $y = -x^2 + 4x + 1$ (parabola)

Observe: Where does each rise or bend? How does adding the $x^2$ term change the shape?

---

### **Solving Linear Systems: Balancing Multiple Conditions**

AI often needs to satisfy several equations at once.

Example system:

$$
2x + 3y = 5 \\
x - y = 2
$$

This can represent balancing multiple conditions, like maximizing returns while keeping risk in check.

---

#### **Solve the System**

Step 1: Solve second equation for $x$:

$$
x = y + 2
$$

Step 2: Plug into the first equation:

$$
2(y + 2) + 3y = 5 \rightarrow 2y + 4 + 3y = 5 \rightarrow 5y = 1 \rightarrow y = 0.2
$$

Step 3: Find $x$:

$$
x = 0.2 + 2 = 2.2
$$

Result:

$$
x = 2.2, \quad y = 0.2
$$

Why does this matter?
AI optimization (like adjusting portfolio weights or risk factors) often comes down to solving large systems like this, sometimes with hundreds of variables.

---

### **Vectors: Representing Data Points**

A **vector** is just an ordered list of numbers, like:

$$
[0.3, -0.5, 0.8]
$$

It can represent any series of features — for example, a snapshot of market indicators.

Why use vectors?
They allow AI to apply consistent operations across multiple inputs:

* Scaling (multiplying all elements),
* Weighting (applying learned coefficients),
* Transformations (changing coordinate systems or representations).

---

#### **Activity: Scale a Vector**

Given:

$$
v = [0.3, -0.5, 0.8], \quad m = 4
$$

Multiply each element:

$$
[0.3 \times 4, -0.5 \times 4, 0.8 \times 4] = [1.2, -2.0, 3.2]
$$

This effectively scales each input feature by its weight.

---

### **Matrices: Organizing Multi-Dimensional Data**

A **matrix** is like a table of vectors — rows and columns.

Example dataset:

| Day | Score 1 | Score 2 |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| 1   | 0.3     | 1.2     |
| 2   | -0.5    | -3.8    |

Matrix form:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.3 & 1.2 \\
-0.5 & -3.8
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Why use matrices?
AI can process **all rows at once** using matrix operations, which is much faster and more efficient than handling each individually.

---

#### **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**

Given:

* Data matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.3 & 1.2 \\
-0.5 & -3.8
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* Coefficient vector:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
m \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Multiply:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.3 \times m + 1.2 \times b \\
-0.5 \times m + (-3.8) \times b
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This gives predictions across multiple rows at once.

---

### **Determinants: Checking System Solvability**

The **determinant** is a single number calculated from a square matrix that tells you if a system has a unique solution.

Example:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Determinant:

$$
(2 \times -1) - (3 \times 1) = -2 - 3 = -5
$$

If determinant ≠ 0, the system has a unique solution.
If determinant = 0, the system has no or infinite solutions.

---

#### Calculate a Determinant**

Given:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 2 \\
1 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Determinant:

$$
(4 \times 3) - (2 \times 1) = 12 - 2 = 10
$$

Result: System is solvable.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Concept        | Role in AI Trading                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Functions      | Map input variables (scores, prices) to predictions.   |
| Polynomials    | Capture nonlinear effects in market reactions.         |
| Linear Systems | Solve for optimal combinations or satisfy constraints. |
| Vectors        | Represent feature sets compactly for mathematical use. |
| Matrices       | Organize and process large datasets efficiently.       |
| Determinants   | Check if a system has unique solutions (solvability).  |

### Think and Discuss

**Why do you think using matrices and linear algebra is helpful when working with large datasets?**

Possible answers:

* It allows efficient computation.
* It helps detect patterns across many variables.
* It scales well when data grows.

---

### **Which is the hardest point for the AI linear model?**


| **Sentiment Score (x)** | **Actual Price Change (y%)** |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0.3                     | 1.2                          |
| -0.5                    | -3.8                         |
| 0.8                     | 4.1                          |
| -0.9                    | -10.0                        |
| 0.6                     | 3.5                          |
| 0.1                     | 0.7                          |
| -0.7                    | -2.5                         |
| 1.0                     | 6.0                          |


Look at:

* Most points follow a **roughly proportional** change (small sentiment → small price shift).
* But **(-0.9, –10.0)** stands out as a **sharp drop**, far steeper than other negative sentiment points.

This makes **(-0.9, –10.0)** the likely **outlier**:
-Much steeper negative price drop.
-Possibly influenced by non-linear effects or sudden market panic.
-Linear models (which fit lines) struggle with such **sharp bends**.

### Summary

In summary:

* **Algebra** gives AI the equations to describe relationships in data.
* **Linear algebra** provides the tools to learn these equations efficiently.

With these tools, AI can turn simple sentiment scores into powerful predictions that help traders like Alex make informed decisions.
