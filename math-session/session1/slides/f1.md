## **Introduction: How AI Relies on Algebra**

In AI-driven trading, algebra and linear algebra form the backbone of predictive systems.

Imagine Alex, a data scientist at a hedge fund, using AI to predict Nvidia’s stock price based on news sentiment scores. Behind the scenes, linear and quadratic equations — the core of algebra — power these AI models, turning raw market data into actionable insights.

Let’s explore how AI uses these mathematical tools.

## **Step 1: Linear Models – The Foundation of AI Predictions**

AI often starts with a **linear model**, which is grounded in linear algebra:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

Where:

* $y$: predicted stock price change
* $x$: sentiment score
* $m$: slope (learned by AI)
* $b$: intercept (adjusted by AI)

In AI, this is known as **linear regression** — algorithms use linear algebra to fit the best line through the data.

**Example:**  
If AI learns $m = 5$, $b = 0$, and $x = 0.8$:

$$
y = 5 \times 0.8 + 0 = 4\%
$$

**Activity 1: Test AI’s Prediction**  
What’s the predicted price change if $x = 0.6$ in $y = 5x + 0$?  
**Answer:**

$$
y = 5 \times 0.6 = 3\%
$$

## **Step 2: Quadratic Models – Capturing Non-Linear Trends**

AI doesn’t stop at linear models. When sentiment triggers unpredictable price swings, AI uses a **quadratic model**:

$$
y = ax^2 + bx + c
$$

The $x^2$ term allows AI to capture non-linear patterns — essential in complex, volatile markets.

**Example:**  
If AI learns $a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 1$, and $x = 0.8$:

$$
y = -2 \times (0.8)^2 + 5 \times 0.8 + 1 = -1.28 + 4 + 1 = 3.72\%
$$

**Activity 2: Why Quadratic?**  
Why does AI prefer quadratic models in volatile markets?  
**Answer:**  
The $x^2$ term bends the prediction curve, helping AI capture large jumps or drops that linear models would miss.

## **Step 3: How AI Learns Using Linear Algebra in Python**

AI doesn’t **guess** the right coefficients — it uses linear algebra techniques (like **least squares**) to learn them from data.

**Python Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sentiment scores and price changes
X = np.array([0.3, -0.5, 0.8]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([1.2, -3.8, 4.1])

# AI fits the model
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
print(f"AI Prediction for x=0.7: {model.predict([[0.7]])[0]:.2f}%")
```


 **Activity 3: Adjust AI’s Prediction**  
How would you modify the code to predict for $x = 0.4$?  
Answer:  
Replace [[0.7]] with [[0.4]]. Expected output ≈ 2.30% (depending on the model fit).

AI Tests and Compares Models  
AI uses backtesting to compare linear vs. quadratic models. In highly volatile markets, quadratic models often perform better due to their algebraic flexibility, allowing AI to handle extreme market movements.

Activity 4: Spot the Outlier  
Given data points: (0.3, 1.2), (-0.5, -3.8), (0.8, 4.1), (-0.9, -10.0), which point challenges AI’s model the most?  
Answer:  
(-0.9, -10.0), a massive drop, requiring the model to adjust for sharp downturns.

Conclusion: AI, Algebra, and Trading  
AI’s Core: Linear and quadratic equations are at the heart of AI predictions.  
Algebra’s Power: Linear algebra enables AI to learn from data efficiently.  
Trading Impact: Algebraic models help AI turn sentiment data into trading profits.
