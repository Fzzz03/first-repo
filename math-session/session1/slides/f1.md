# Algebra and Linear Algebra in AI

Algebra and linear algebra might seem like complex math topics, but they are actually the foundation of many technologies that affect our lives, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) in trading.

Imagine Alex, a data scientist at a hedge fund. His goal is to help predict Nvidia’s stock price by analyzing news articles about the company. Alex uses AI to assign a **sentiment score** to each news item, which shows whether the news is positive or negative.

But how does AI turn these sentiment scores into predictions of the stock price?
This is where **algebra** and **linear algebra** come into play.

### What is Algebra?

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations.
It helps us describe how different things relate to each other.

For example, in the equation:

$$
y = m x + b
$$

algebra helps express the relationship between $x$ (input) and $y$ (output) using constants $m$ and $b$.

---

### What is Linear Algebra?

Linear algebra extends these ideas to work with **vectors** and **matrices**, which are like lists and tables of numbers.
It helps us analyze **many data points at once** and is essential for AI models working with large datasets.

---

### Linear Models in AI

Algebra lets us describe relationships between numbers using equations.
A simple and common algebraic equation AI uses is:

$$
y = m x + b
$$

Where:

* $y$ is the predicted change in Nvidia’s stock price (in percent),
* $x$ is the sentiment score from news,
* $m$ is the slope that AI learns (how strongly sentiment affects price),
* $b$ is the intercept AI adjusts (baseline change).

This is called a **linear model**, which you can think of as a straight line drawn through a set of data points.

### Sentiment Scores and Price Changes

| Sentiment Score ($x$) | Actual Price Change ($y$ percent) |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0.3                   | 1.2                               |
| -0.5                  | -3.8                              |
| 0.8                   | 4.1                               |
| -0.9                  | -10.0                             |

### Predict the Price Change

If AI finds:

* $m = 4$
* $b = 0.5$

What is the predicted price change when $x = 1.0$?

**Solution**:

$$
y = 4 \times 1.0 + 0.5 = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 \text{ percent}
$$


### Understanding Slope and Intercept

* **What does the slope $m$ represent in this context?**
  It shows how much the price is expected to change for each unit change in sentiment.

* **What would it mean if $m$ were zero?**
  It would mean sentiment has no effect on price.

* **What role does the intercept $b$ play if $x = 0$?**
  It represents the baseline change when sentiment is neutral.



### When Linear Models Are Not Enough

Stock prices do not always move in a straight-line pattern. Markets can be **unpredictable and volatile**. That is why AI sometimes uses more complex models like quadratic equations:

$$
y = a x^2 + b x + c
$$

This equation adds an $x^2$ term, which allows the prediction curve to bend and better capture real-world ups and downs.

---

### Explore Non-Linearity

If:

* $a = -1$,
* $b = 3$,
* $c = 1$,

Calculate the predicted price change for $x = 1$.

**Solution**:

$$
y = -1 \times (1)^2 + 3 \times 1 + 1 = -1 + 3 + 1 = 3
$$

---

### Visualizing Curves

**How does adding the $x^2$ term change the shape of the prediction compared to the straight line?**
Try sketching a simple curve for both linear and quadratic equations to see the difference.

* Linear: straight line.
* Quadratic: curve that bends up or down depending on $a$.

### How Does AI Learn These Numbers?

AI does not guess these coefficients ($m, b, a, c$) randomly.
It **learns** them from data using **linear algebra**.

Linear algebra is the branch of math that helps AI handle **many numbers at once**, often arranged in tables called **matrices**.
Using these tools, AI can find the best-fitting equations for the data.

### How AI Learns

In Alex’s case, AI:

1. Looks at many past pairs of sentiment scores and actual price changes.
2. Organizes this data in matrices.
3. Uses linear algebra techniques to calculate the coefficients that minimize prediction errors.

---

### What Are Matrices?

Imagine a spreadsheet where each row is a different day’s sentiment and price change.
That is like a matrix.

**Questions**:

* How might arranging data this way help AI spot patterns?
* What happens when the dataset gets very large?

---

### Simple Matrix Example

Create a small $2 \times 2$ matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.3 & 1.2 \\
-0.5 & -3.8
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Multiply it by a vector of coefficients $[m, b]$ to see how the prediction is calculated.

### Think and Discuss

**Why do you think using matrices and linear algebra is helpful when working with large datasets?**

Possible answers:

* It allows efficient computation.
* It helps detect patterns across many variables.
* It scales well when data grows.

### Spot the Outlier

Looking at the data points in the table, which point do you think will be hardest for AI’s linear model to predict accurately?
Why?



### Summary

In summary:

* **Algebra** gives AI the equations to describe relationships in data.
* **Linear algebra** provides the tools to learn these equations efficiently.

With these tools, AI can turn simple sentiment scores into powerful predictions that help traders like Alex make informed decisions.
